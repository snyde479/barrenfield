There are three ways to run the code.

First, you can just compile and run the tests using whatever method you prefer (I used Eclipse.)

Second, you can compile and run the Main and the rest of the code with a single input to get the output of that input.

Third, you can compile and run the Main without any input and then follow the instructions given to standard out.
